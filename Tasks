Achieve reliable performance with:
1. 2 robots and food - Currently doing this
2. 2 robots and food and walls
3. 2+ robots and food and walls
4. 2+ robots and predators and food and walls

Potential Issues:
1. To approach problem of low entropy starting configurations:
In Model.lua use "policy:add(nn.Linear(self.hiddenSize, self.m):init('weight', nninit.uniform, -3e-3, 3e-3))"

2. View current entropy with:
A3CAgent:progress(steps)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)

3. Fix issue of only one agent subscribing to gazebo clock

4. The drops in performance are due to choosing right predominantly over left and circling. I don't know why
right is chosen over left but the circling may be a temporarily good strategy since it keeps the robot viewing
the food for longer.
Really need to work on finding the vector the current robot is pointing and use that to make a cone.
Find out when food items leave the cone and put them back in the cone.
This will encourage forward moving behaviour which can then be refined to turning into food.
Also less food will be required for the same observations.

I just reduced spawning range so food spawns in a tighter circle. This may further promote circling.

Really to do 2 robot, walls and food ASAP since the circling strategy here will be inefficient.
Will likely need to reward for speed, green view and food.
